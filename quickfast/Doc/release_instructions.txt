To generate a new release of QuickFAST:

Insure there are no warnings or errors in the build.
Insure all tests are passing both release and debug builds.
Insure that Doxygen runs with no (or very few) errors.

Edit Common/Version.h
  -- check version number -- it should be set correctly already
  -- comment out the [prerelease] modifier in the version number.
  -- update copyright date if necessary
Edit src/Doxyfile
Run Doxygen
check these files (src/Doxyfile and Version.h) into the repostory.

Tag the repository and push to repo:
  hg tag Vn_n
  hg push

  example: hg tag V1_5
           hg push

Repeat for each build type
  
  Clone the repo to a new directory:
    hg clone https://user_id@code.google.com/p/quickfast quickfast_n_n_n   
  Switch to the tag:
    cd quickfast_1_5_0
    hg checkout V1_5

  Package Up:
    Windows source:
      Get a fresh clone from the repository into a directory named 
        quickfast_v_v_v, like quickfast_1_5_0
      Delete the .hg directory in the new dir
      Delete the .hgignore and .hgtags files
      Create a zip file named quickfast_win_src_v_v_v.zip
      Copy the exported directory into the zip file
      Upload the file with summary: "Windows Source Distribution VN.N" and
        description: "A zip file containing the source of QuickFAST with windows
        line endings." and tags of "Type-Source" and "OpSys-Windows"
